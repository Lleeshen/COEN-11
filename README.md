# COEN 11

Advanced Programming Class Labs, taken Winter 2016

Develop a basic model for surf lessons with C, and add funcionality for later labs.

Some labs implement the surf lessons with array, others with linked list.

Added functions by Lab10 include but not limited to loading initial status from file, multithreading, autosaving, and encryption with XOR.
